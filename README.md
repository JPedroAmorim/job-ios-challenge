`fastlane` in this project is run through `Bundle`. To install `Bundle`, do:

```bash
gem install bundler
```

To install `fastlane` and its dependencies, from the project's root directory, do:

```bash
cd JobsityChallenge && bundle install
```

To run `fastlane` before every commit and push action, from the project's root directory, do:

```bash
chmod ug+x .git/hooks/*
echo "cd JobsityChallenge && bundle exec fastlane ci_check" > .git/hooks/pre-commit
echo "cd JobsityChallenge && bundle exec fastlane ci_check" > .git/hooks/pre-push
```
