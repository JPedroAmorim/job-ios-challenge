## Prerequisites (Building)

In order to build this application, you'll need [üõ† Xcode 14+]

The project itself doesn't use any external package/dependency, so in order to build on a simulator, the Xcode 14+ requirement is sufficient.

If you want to build it on device, iOS 16 is also a requirement (the deployment target of this project is set to iOS 16).
You'll also need a [Provisioning Profile] to run on device.

## Prerequisites (Development)

This project uses [Swiftlint] for linting in build scripts and [Fastlane] as a mean to build the project, test and lint it pre-commit and pre-push actions.

To install `swiftlint`, from the command line, do:

```bash
brew install swiftlint
```

**NOTE**: This is assuming [üç∫ Homebrew] as your `MacOS` package manager of choice.

`fastlane` in this project is run through [Bundler]. To install `Bundler`, do:

```bash
gem install bundler
```

To install `fastlane` and its dependencies, from the project's root directory, do:

```bash
cd JobsityChallenge && bundle install
```

To run `fastlane` before every commit and push action, from the project's root directory, do:

```bash
chmod ug+x .git/hooks/*
echo "cd JobsityChallenge && bundle exec fastlane ci_check" > .git/hooks/pre-commit
echo "cd JobsityChallenge && bundle exec fastlane ci_check" > .git/hooks/pre-push
```

To add `swiftlint` as a build script of the project, on `Xcode`, under `JobsityChallenge>Build Phases`, add the following `Run Script Phase`:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/opt/homebrew/bin"
if which swiftlint > /dev/null; then
  swiftlint
else
  echo "warning: SwiftLint not installed, download from https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint"
fi
```

This already accounts for known issues with Apple Silicon (M1) Machines (see https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint#xcode)

## Project Architecture Overview

This project uses a very straightforward, simple and scalable approach of `MVVVM-C` (Model - View - ViewModel - Coordinator), using `SwiftUI` as its main UI framework.

The main target of the app is `JobsityChallenge`, but there's a unit test target as well, named 'JobsityChallengeTests`.
